    <p>War - card game</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="lab.exe">Sample application</a></li>
        <li>
            Description:
            <ul>
                <li>the task is to write a war card game</li>
			</ul>
        <li>
            Requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Main window:
                    <ul>
                        <li>minimal size: 600 x 400, start size: 800 x 450</li>
						<li>"This is war" on the title bar</li>
                        <li>In the middle, in the upper part of the window there are score counters of the players</li>
                        <li>On the bottom on the left there are two buttons Reset and Skip to End</li>
                        <li>On the bottom on the right there is a checkbox "show wars"</li>
                        <li>In the middle on the left and right there are two buttons displaying bottom of a card. Below those buttons there are counter showing how many cards each player has</li>
                        <li>In the middle, two images displaying players' cards</li>                        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Card button (size 100 x 150px):
                    <ul>
                        <li>create appropriate Style, so:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Buttons have image displaying bottom of a card</li>
								<li>Button will have shadow effect</li>
								<li>Cursor is changed to hand on mouse hover</li>
								<li>After hovering the button with the mouse, there is also a blur effect with the radius of 30</li>
								<li>when you press the button, the corresponding cards appear - discovered</li>
							</ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>
                    Card images:
                    <ul>
                        <li>are in cards.jpg file, and should be cut properly</li>
                        <li>each card in cards.jpg has size 225 x 315 px</li>
                        <li>bottom of a card is in back1.png file</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>
                    Game logic:
                    <ul>
                        <li>in the laboratory version, the cards do not have to be drawn,  they can be distributed in a fixed order</li>
                        <li>the cards are stored in the appropriate structure</li>
                        <li>after pressing the player's card button (on the left or right side) cards from the top of player's cards are displayed in the middle of the window</li>
                        <li>after the cards appear in the middle, the war begins</li>
						<ul>
							<li>in the laboratory version, the cards are lost, i.e. they do not return to the winning player.</li>
							<li>first player receives a point if he has a card with a higher value</li>
							<li>second player receives a point if he has a card with a higher value</li>
							<li>both players receive one point if they have a card of the same value</li>
							<li>we do not take into account the color of the card</li>
							<li>after the cards are over, buttons are disabled and are not showing the card image</li>
							<li>In case of uncertainty look at the sample app</li>
						</ul>
                    </ul>
                </li>
				<li>
                    Buttons on the bottom:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reset button draws cards to players</li>
                        <li>Skip to end button plays the whole game at once, and calculates the points</li>
                        <li>in case of war (ie both players showed the card with the same value) and if the checkbox show wars is checked display MessageBox</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
        <li>
            Comments:
            <ul>
            	<li>the application is resistant to window scaling, the controls adapt to the size changes of the main application window</li>
                <li>In case of uncertainty the program must be compatible with the behavior and appearance of the sample application, however, do not rely on potential bugs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Tips:
            <ul>
                <li>Create classes for Card and Player</li>
                <li>INotifyPropertyChanged</li>
                <li>BitmapSource</li>
                <li>Fill, Stretch</li>
                <li>CroppedBitmap</li>
                <li>ControlTemplate</li>
                <li>DropShadowEffect</li>
				<li>BlurRadius</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Scoring:
            <ul>
                <li>4 points - appearance</li>
				<ul>
					<li>buttons with an image of card</li>
					<li>buttons have shadow effect</li>
					<li>on hover the cursor changes and the blur effect appears</li>
					<li>displaying random cards in the middle after pressing the button</li>
				</ul>
				<li>4 points - logic</li>
				<ul>
					<li>simplified war game logic, buttons instead of card photos can have numbers that specify the value of the card. Simplified, ie that the cards do not return to the end of the player's cards, they only disappear. In addition, when there is a war, both players receive one point</li>
					<li>the ability to play the whole game at once after pressing "Skip to end"</li>
					<li>displaying MessageBox when war occurs and when Checkbox Show Wars is selected</li>
					<li>players' card and score counters</li>
					<li>Reset button draws cards and distributes them to players. Then the new game begins</li>
				</ul>
            </ul>
        </li>

    <h4>WPF - part II home</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="home.exe">Sample app</a></li>
		<li><b>the application should look like the sample app!</b></li>
        <li>
            Description:
            <ul>
                <li>The initial and minimum size of the window is: 600x1000px</li>
                <li>The main window is divided into two parts</li>
                    <ul>
						<li>The right part, 250px wide, the left one occupying the rest of the window</li>
                    </ul>  
				<li>War game logic</li>
                    <ul>
						<li>When the card is displayed on the table, 3 situations are possible</li>
						<ul>
								<li>The player on the left has a better card and wins the round</li>
								<li>The player on the right has a better card and wins the round</li>
								<li>Both players have a card with the same value, then war occurs. Players place one card face down, and then face the card again and again until it is won by one of the players</li>
							</ul>
						<li>The cards from the table go to the player who wins. The order is that first the opponent's cards are added at the end of winner player cards. Next winning player cards from the table are added at the end of winner player cards</li>
						<li>The game ends when one of the players loses all the cards</li>
						<li>If in doubt about the rules, please take a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)">here</a></li>
                    </ul> 					
				<li>Animations</li>
                    <ul>
						<li>Animation of moving cards from the player to the middle of the table</li>
						<li>Animation of flipping the card - only if it is needed (see example application)</li>
						<li>Animation of returning cards to the winner. The corresponding cards (first the loser) are turned over (if necessary) and then moved to the winning player. Then the same happens with the cards of the winner</li>
						<li>Animations should be performed in the right order. You can use the DoubleAnimation.Completed event to launch animation of the next card</li>
						<li>Sliding animations can be implemented using TranslateTransform, and rotation animations using ScaleTransform (with ScaleX change from -1 to 1, and at the right time change Source Image)</li>
						<li>When returning cards to the player, make sure that the previous cards are displayed correctly (as in the example application)</li>
						<li>During the animation, the Reset and Skip To End buttons and the player tab buttons are disabled</li>
						<li>Animations are smooth, i.e. there is visible acceleration and braking effect at the beginning and end of the animation</li>
						<li>The time of individual animations can be changed using two sliders. These sliders have values from 0.1s to 2s, and their current value is displayed in the appropriate format (two decimal places) on the right side of the slider</li>
                    </ul>
					<li>Player's cards tab</li>
						<ul>
							<li>There are two listboxes in it. In the left there are cards of the left player, on the right side cards of the right player. To display cards, create the appropriate template and bind with the player's list of cards</li>
							<li>The list of cards is synchronized with the animations</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Highscores tab</li>
						<ul>
							<li>At the end of each game, the winning player is added to the results list. The position on the list depends on the result obtained. The elements in the list are displayed in the same way as in the example application</li>
						</ul>		
				<li>The Change Back button opens the file selection dialog in which you can select an image. The selected photo changes the image of the bottom of a card</li>
				<li>The Simulate button simulates consecutive moves. After pressing it, simulation can be stopped, stopping occurs after the current animation has finished</li>
				<li>The Reset button randomly deals cards to players in random order</li>
				<li>The player card button performs one game movement with the animation</li>
				<li>The skip to end button leads to the end of the game, the animations are skipped</li>
				<li>Checkbox show wars displays relevant messages during the war</li>
			</li>
			</ul>
        <li>
            Additional requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>it is mandatory to meet all the requirements of part one of the first task</li>
                <li>be careful with memory leaks when using Image.Source</li>
                <li>use binding when possible</li>
                <li>make sure all animations are correct</li>
                <li>in case of ambiguity, the program must be compatible with the behavior and appearance of the sample application (with the exception of potential bugs)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Tips:
            <ul>
                <li>DoubleAnimation</li>
                <li>DoubleAnimation.Complete</li>
				<li>EasingFunction = new QuarticEase()</li>
				<li>Panel.ZIndex - it is used to set elements on top or on the bottom of each other</li>
                <li>control.TransformToAncestor(Application.Current.MainWindow).Transform(new Point(0, 0)) - is used to get the location of the control in the main window. The point (X, Y) is returned</li>
				<li>ObservableCollection</li>
				<li>BitmapSource.Freeze()</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoring:
            <ul>
                <li>complete logic of the game including the war - 2 points</li>
                <li>list of players' cards - creating a simple DataTemplate and binding to ObservableCollection - 1 point</li>
                <li>list of highscores - creating a simple DataTemplate and binding to ObservableCollection - 1 point</li>
                <li>change the bottom of a card image - load the file and create a bitmap- 1 point</li>
                <li>slider to control the animation time and displaying slider value in the appropriate format - 1 point</li>
                <li>animation of two cards from players to the table (translation and rotation - without the logic of war) - 1.5 point</li>
                <li>animation of returning cards to players (turnover and translation) in the right order - 1 point</li>
                <li>Animation of the returning cards to players taking into account the case of war - 2pkt</li>
				<li>card animations during the war (right cards are displayed and right are hidden) - 1.5pkt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
